Hexel Files Compatibility

The roof tiles and anything in folders marked Shards is only going to work in Hexels Beta version. Everything else is Trixels based and will work just fine in Hexels Pro 1.2.

PNG Tile files

All the PNG tiles should work with your preferred graphics program - I've tested them in the GIMP and Aseprite.
